# Explorations of openness

## Goals for this exploration

Help us all understand how this group thinks about openness, their motivations and possible pain-points.

Identify where open practices can be most effectively applied in the work this group does.

How can we collectively maximise the open impact of OpenPlant

## Open vs. Transparent

- transparent
  - Public, but not necessarily enabling participation.
- passively transparent
  - Not private; decisions aren’t actively hidden, but are difficult to locate. They may not even be documented. This is usually not done intentionally.
- actively transparent
  - Everything is written down, is easily searchable and is locatable by interested parties. This requires intentional, sustained effort.
- open
  - Public and participatory. This requires structuring efforts so that "outsiders" can meaningfully participate (and become "insiders" as appropriate).

## Trying to have impact without vast amounts of money

- minimum viable bureaucracy (https://air.mozilla.org/minimum-viable-bureaucracy/)
- self-organising communities
- the cathedral and the bazaar
- things that need to be high quality:
  - communication
  - information accessibility
  - trust
- open is the most effective model

## valid obstacles

- it takes more work
- people will criticize my work
- we're not ready

## what gear of open?

- closed
- not yet
- open
- shout it from the rooftops

we all need to decide what mode we're comfortable in now
and what mode we want to be in

## In practise

- publishing open access
- making code open source
- open discussion
- high quality documentation
- bypassing restrictive systems

## More options

- explore specific tools and platforms
- mapping digital practices
- roadmapping
